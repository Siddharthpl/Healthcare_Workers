## ✅ Features Implemented

### Manager
- **Set Location Perimeter:** Managers can define the allowed clock-in area (e.g., 2km radius).
- **Staff Table:** Real-time table of all currently clocked-in staff.
- **Clock-In/Out History:** For each staff, see when and where they clocked in/out.
- **Analytics Dashboard:** 
  - Average hours per day (all staff)
  - Daily clock-in counts
  - Total hours per staff (last week)
  - Visualized with Chart.js

### Care Worker
- **Clock In/Out:** Can clock in only within perimeter; can clock out when clocked in.
- **Optional Notes:** Add notes on clock-in/out.
- **Location Restriction:** App prevents clock-in outside perimeter and gives clear feedback.
- **History:** View personal clock-in/out history.

### Authentication
- **Auth0 Integration:** Google/email login, registration, and logout.
- **Role-Based Access:** Separate dashboards for managers and care workers.

### Bonus Feature
- **Automatic Location Detection:** 
  - App tracks care worker’s location in real-time.
  - Notifies to clock in when entering perimeter, to clock out when leaving.

- The codebase is modular, with clear separation of concerns (components, context, hooks, API).
- Prisma schema models users, organizations, and clock records with location and notes.
- Real-time location and notifications are handled in the CareWorkerDashboard component.
- Authentication and role management are enforced throughout the app.
- The UI is responsive and uses Ant Design for a professional look.
